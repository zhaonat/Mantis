MPI_ABORT was invoked on rank 10 in communicator MPI_COMM_WORLD 
with errorcode 1.

NOTE: invoking MPI_ABORT causes Open MPI to kill all MPI processes.
You may or may not see output from other processes, depending on
exactly when Open MPI kills them.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
mpirun has exited due to process rank 5 with PID 330 on
node compute-0-27.local exiting without calling "finalize". This may
have caused other processes in the application to be
terminated by signals sent by mpirun (as reported here).
