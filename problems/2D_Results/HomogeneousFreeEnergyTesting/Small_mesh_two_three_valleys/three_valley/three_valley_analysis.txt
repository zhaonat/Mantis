Unstable IC Analysis:
even with a kappa value of 0.25, mobility = 1, this demonstrates that the system evolves towards the precise minima of the homogeneous free energy function.
Unfortunately, because of periodic boundary conditions, there is some weird behavior at the top and bottom but does not detract from the validity of the results.
