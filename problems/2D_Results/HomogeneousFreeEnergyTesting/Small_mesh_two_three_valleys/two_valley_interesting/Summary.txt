So it seems that the 0 portion of ICs splits perfectly into layers...wonder what happens if you just have a 0 phase alone.
in the uniform comparison folder, we have an initial perturbation in what starts as a homogeneous background. Kappa is so small, that interfaces can be formed willy nilly

The perfect layer splitting seems to occur both in 10-1IC and PerturbationComparison becuase kappa is so small (kappa = 0.01) so there is literally no cost in forming an interface. However, the system still wants to separate according to the cahn hilliard equation.

Let's calculate the difference between interfacial energy and the height of the double well.
sigma = sqrt(well_height*kappa)
well: 1/4
kappa = 0.01
sigma = 0.05
the interfacial energy is four times smaller than the barrier energy...barrier energy forces separation of phases, interfacial energy prevents formation of interfaces

I will run the simulations again with k = 0.25 
well: 1/4
k = 0.25
sigma = 1/4
interfacial energy and well barrier are similar so they should compete equally...
In the comparison simulation, which just starts with a uniform dot, we get concentric layers instead of a complex pattern...this represents the simplest possible evolution that can be achieved
