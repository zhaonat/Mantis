potential well being tested is of the form:
W*(1-c)^2*(1+c)^2*(c)^2-2.1+c^4
W is a constant
This has two real zeros at plus-minus 1.17, a smaller local min at 0
unfortunately, as this simulation progresses, it seems the amount of material seems to decrease, 
which is not good because this is working under periodic boundary conditions
