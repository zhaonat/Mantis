This experiment is done on the mac computer...
Appears to be a tendency for the system to overpressurize rather than increase the amount of surface area. 
WE will note that geometrically though, the thinner a rectangle you have,
the better it is in terms of surface area reduction, to have the rectangle transform into a circle.
