README for the Four_Layer_Height_Tests
simulation results for a four strip system with a single defect of varying penetration.
Results show that at some critical penetration, the defect will merge with the next layer and disrupt the layer organization.
Else, the layer will heal, though with periodic boundary conditions and the current time step, the extent of healing is unknown...
see long duration version of this simulation.
