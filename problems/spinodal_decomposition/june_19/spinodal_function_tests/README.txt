Series of test that analyze what happens if the minima of the potential function are not at equal heights relative to each other...
ICs used here are random ICs.
From the lecture notes, we see that for the spinodal decomposition to occur g''(c0) <0 so our function should always encapsulate this feature 
BUT, what happens if this spinodal area is missing?

other investigations could be of interest as well...i.e. what if there are three distinct phases (not sure how phi would capture a triphase solution)
theoretically of course, we expect that if one phase is more stable than the other, then the system will spinodally decompose exclusively into that phase.

1st black bird function doesn't have the appropriate minimum aside from the one at 0...still workgin on that.
Results:
result of the primary test of the unequal heights of the minima suggests an accelerated move toward spinodal decomposition. The mixture immediately separates into bubbles...time evolution then suggests that the bubbles begin to coalesce or grow larger to reach some stable equilibrium (seems like matter is conserved in this simulation). few coalescence of the bubbles...many bubbles simply 'popped' and remianing ones spontaneously grew larger in size.
